This system is really good.,1
It is quiet good,1
outcome based education teaches thinking skills and engages students more,1
When the student creates a product this in much more meaningful than answers on a test.,1
Outcome based education provides learning more similar to real world applications.,1
"With a clear sense of what needs to be accomplished, instructors will be able to structure their lessons around the student’s needs.",1
"OBE does not specify a specific method of instruction, leaving instructors free to teach their students using any method",1
its not good,0
Instructors will also be able to recognize diversity among students by using various teaching and assessment techniques during their class.,1
OBE system has been very effective for me. helping me to focus on my skills more rather than theory only.,1
It is the Best,1
OBE ensures whether we can use whatever we learn that we can use in our real life.,1
Bad format for evaluating code based courses. As programming skills do not depend on descriptive answers.Even if a student understands a topic in theory it does not mean the student will do good in practical coding.,0
OBE empowers students to take more responsibility for their own learning and supports the move to greater student engagement with the curriculum and to student-centered approaches.,1
"OBE is a powerful education strategy that should be used as a focus for curriculum planning, as a means of making informed discussions about the approaches to teaching and learning be adopted, and as a basis for the assessment of students/trainees and of the education programme itself",1
Good system.,1
this is a good system.,1
we learned a lot by attending the course.,1
OBE ensures whether we can use whatever we learn that we can use in our real life.,1
very good,1
I think OBE is really a challanging system.,1

I think it works good,1
This evalution system is good for education system and every subject need to be under OBE,1
works well,1

"The outcomes based approach works best for tasks or knowledge that are easily measured, such as whether someone can drive a forklift, rather than other topics where it's more speculative or subjective and therefore harder to measure, such as whether someone is able to write good music. The obvious issue in this example is defining 'good'.",1
"The focus with the outcomes based approach is on the trainee and on them successfully achieving a specified and preferably a well-defined outcome. Therefore it is important for a systematic process to be followed, starting with a planning or analysis phase.",1
its not bad,1
OBE is good for practical & real life study base understanding.,1
It is much needed for students to evaluate their actual performance,1
i am not clear about this system,0
It helps to evaluate students performance on each course,1
"It is helping in many courses like TOC, compiler.",1
 some courses has no effect of OBE at all.i mean some courses are failing to achieve the goal of OBE.,0
But it's really a good initiative. Needs a lot improvement though.,1
No feedback.I donn't understand it at all. Thank you.,0
It's very good for overall education in a course,1
It is a good evaluation system because here student can show his creativity by presenting his/her openion in exam by his/her own logic or example.,1
OBE is a education system which is based on outcomes that is very good method in education field.,1
It helps us to learn in practical way. So we can develop us in proper way.,1
"Using this system we know about the outcome based education, used to plan the curriculum, monitor its implementation, evaluate it and assess student's achievement",1
Yes. It's a very good approach.,1
"As the outcome of a will be revealed for individual student, this approach is good to evaluate a student's course result.",1
OBE is really good way to evaluate students.,1
But it’s becomes very problematic to some courses as some courses are already hard enough to pass rather than scoring A+.,0
For me I think OBE shouldn’t be in every courses.,0
It is a good thing for education.,1
OBE means outcome based education system,1
It is very effective education systems for all students,1
.On this evaluation system we can learn a proper knowledge about real world work environment.,1
"Honestly speaking, as a student who wants to finish a course without much trouble and a strict requirement to pass a certain test, I don't want it. (Yes I know I am guilty)",0
"But after learning that, this OBE evaluation will be included in our CV and will be beneficial to us looking for jobs abroad, I have to come to accept it. It is a test I must go through even though I don't like it.",1
"Overall, OBE is quite normal. In terms of difficulty, it's a little bit harder than the average questions but it is nothing impossible. So it can be given. ",1
"The only problem I have and I think, most students have, is that the OBE test is mandatory to be passed separately along with the main test.",0
This creates a certain problem.,0
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to write out my thoughts about this system and oblige thereby.,1
I am satisfied as a student,1
I think the evaluation system does a great job.,1
There is much more to improve though.,0
It is good for student doing obe,1
not that bad of a curriculum,1
very effective and wise way of teaching and judging a student,1
OBE related course can be helpful to enrich the learning capability of students.,1
The OBE evaluation system is a worldly recognised system that is operated to have a common way of evaluating all the students of the world.,1
OBE related course can be helpful to enrich the learning capability of students.,1
Some time it's good .But most of the time it's bad.,1
Outcome based education mainly focus on what students learn on their courses.,0
It helps to evaluate both teachers and students to learn about lackings and fulfillness about knowledge.,1
Yaah. The OBE evaluation system is up to the mark I guess.,1
Its a good system to determine a students quality as well as skill level.,1
I don't think it's helpful for the students.. This system shouldn't be used,0
OBE also uses the same methodology formally and informally adopted in actual workplace to achieve outcomes.,1
"It focuses on the following skills when developing curricula and outcomes: 1.Life skills,0.Basic skills,0.Professional and vocational skills, 4.Intellectual skills,5.Interpersonal and 6.personal skills.",1
Its very good for our educationsystem,1
Its great.,1
Its good enough to judge.,1
It's good,1
IT is one of the good way but hard kind off,1
I think OBE is a great system as it evaluates our grades in a more efficient way,1
it is good for student doing obe,1
outcome-based education (OBE) represents the most important development in education.,1
This system can be used to support curriculum renewal and to support the revision of professional accreditation standards.,1
OBE system is the Faul system,0
obe evaluation system is the useless system,0
OBE is a perfect way to main the grade of Engineering Study,1
I prefer OBE system.,1
it will provide more opportunities to students and also page the way for better future of the country.,1
It will create more eligible faculty and trainers which is ultimately good for us as well,1
OBE is very important for all student now a days,1
Therefore we don’t get enough chance to make skilled ourself.,0
"Oftentimes students take OBE exams lightly as they know that if most of the students of their class pass, they will pass as well.",0
"OBE is a technique for insuring that more students learn well,but it applies to any content.",1
It represents a clearly focused and powerful way of organizing and operating instructional systems.,1
Very effective system,1
OBE has its importance since it is a way through which university will have more authorization.,1
It is very important to take this kind of exams for the betterment of students and universities,1
Because it increases the ability and knowledge.,1
Outcome-based education offers many advantages for students as a way of achieving this,1
It emphasizes relevance in the curriculum and accountability,1
can provide a clear and unambiguous framework for curriculum planning which has an intuitive appeal,1
It's helping to the students for learning is he/she understood or not.I think it's very essential for student to know how to work done.,1
"in favor of making students demonstrate that they ""know and are able to do"" whatever the required outcomes are.",1
Crying need,1
Outcome-based education or outcomes-based education (OBE) is an educational theory that bases each part of an educational system around goals (outcomes).,1
"By the end of the educational experience, each student should have achieved the goal. There is no single specified style of teaching or assessment in OBE",0
"At present,the OBE System is being widely used by leading institutions in Bangladesh.",1
OBE has proven to be a in helping institutions measure their learning outcomes,1
at the same time students to develop new skills that prepare them to stand out with their global counterparts,1
These factors can contribute to raising the education standard.Students are also admiring the System.,1
"As a Student, I also think this will raise the Standard of our Education.",1
I concur that result based training can be viable,1
"Be that as it may, it has constraints.",0
"Furthermore, OBE may be useful for guidance and preparing",1
"however, it isn't perfect with a liberal idea of training, particularly in expressions and humanities.",0
"At long last, inspite of the fact that OBE may improve the structure of the exercises and substance, it doesn't really improve the nature of the educational program.",0
Many of the students face problems on understanding the exam evaluation system.,0
But at the same time as the evaluation is done in parts of knowledge that a student has done it is quite useful for the teachers and students both to know how much the course has been finished.,1
But I would say if the students are properly instructed properly then the OBE evaluation system will be a best way for examining a students learning in the course.,1
"For OBE each of Engineering students have hugely Benefited, their Skills ability growing for a lot.",1
this is very essential.,1
So I must say OBE evaluation System doing a Great Impact on our Education.,1
Obe system is nearly related with creative education system.It actually helps students to think over a matter deeply.,1
obe question system helps to find each and every side of a matter properly.,1
it can be said that obe system is efficient as well as effective.,1
personally I don't think it gives better outcome,0
OBE can help students in many ways like OBE means clearly focusing and organizing everything in an educational system,1
essential for all students to be able to do successfully at the end of their learning.,1
It's a very good idea to improve our education system,1
"what the school provides to students, in favor of making students demonstrate that they ""know and are able to do"" whatever the required outcomes are.",1
It is useful for who pass the OBE evaluation exam or who passed the course but if any student didn't get pass mark in the OBE evaluation then they will not get any benefits from it so we just differ students from this evaluation.,0
Don't understand this system properly yet,0
OBE evaluation is good for student and teacher.,1
But we can not evaluate it properly.,0
"OBE results in increased student and teacher self-esteem, higher academic success for more students, decreased drop-outs and several other benefits",1
It’s a good process to evaluate the marks and other things,1
The focus on outcomes creates a clear expectation of what needs to be accomplished by the end of the course.,1
Overall its good.. . ,1
It helps a student to get a good outcome from the topics he / she learned in the class.,1
I think it's important to find the level of their skill whenever a student is having any technical course.,1
"So, for that I think the OBE is a very good way.",1
Effective for us,1
When I first came to know about the OBE course I had no idea what is was.The teacher didn't explain anything in details.,0
I didn't quiet get the marks distribution.For example: in quiz best 0 out of 0 are always counted.Then an extra quiz was takes as a part of OBE quiz without any explanation how the marks were being distributed. Again in another subject I had given all 0 normal quizzes and missed the OBE quiz and got a very poor marks despite having good marks in all the quizzes and tests .how was is distributed.,0
No clue.What is the difference between normal assignments and test assignments ,0
But I don't like it's testing method.I think this system can be advantage for students who are good in studies but this system is not favorable or disadvantage for students who are not good in studies.,0
The students who are not good in studies can't answer properly and fulfill all criteria of OBE system.Also this system is extra burden on instructors and educational institutions.,0
They have to take OBE exam and also have to send evidence and final report to high level.This is really troublesome for them.,0
"That's why I don't like OBE's criteria, it should be changed to be favorable towards all kind of students, or it should not use in the education sector at all.",0
I like it,1
Basically it improves the different skills of particular subjects.,1
The focus on outcomes creates a clear expectation of what needs to be accomplished by the end of the course.,1
"In addition, different universities does not follow the same evaluation criteria for assessing the students performance, which makes the OBE system more complex.",0
I didn't understand anything about OBE.,0
I just attend the OBE exam without knowing that what is the benefits of it.,0
OBE is beneficial to teach  the proper knowledge of the course realistically.,1
OBE is to stressful  ,0
OBE is not clear than current system,0
Its a great pleasure.,0
We are not clear about OBE.,0
OBE is painful ,0
"This creates a certain problem. Suppose a student passed a exam overall, but failed to get minimum marks from the OBE part of questions.  ",0
So one can understand that this requirement is quite troublesome. But I also understand that this is required.,0
OBE  increases our  thinking level .        ,1
I have no idea.Even teachers seemed confused regarding the matter.Its making things volatile and difficult .,0
Obe gives us too much stress because we need to attend an extra evaluation in a course                         ,0
If we focus on OBE we can give highest level of performance and  we can get better result at the end  of the course. 				,1
The OBE system is good for learners.	,1
It help students to learn what is mostly needed for the time and hour.                ,1
"It evaluates the performance of students based on their qualities, skills and knowledge as their outcomes.                        ",1
If we focus on OBE we can get over from any problem we face in our career.                 ,1
OBE departs from traditional education in its assumption that all students can learn well.                                                  ,1
OBE is the best system and OBE evaluation is the best way to evaluate.,1
OBE focuses on some specific thing like to increase the knowledge of a student.                                                         ,1
Also teachers will change there teaching style and they will try to give their best performance in the class so that the student can understand the lecture easily.,1
"I support OBE , we need it in educational field.         ",1
I have less idea about OBE. As I know OBE evaluation is for higher graduation.                         ,0
They can not find education as fun. They become very worried when exams begin. But shouldn’t be.,0
it is effective in every pros and cons. students can focus on every part of study material.                        ,1
OBE is a good practise for students.,1
It is a good initiative ,1
"OBE is great as this method emphasizes outcome of something that is learned. If a person can't apply what he/she has learned, then his/her education is useless.                                                ",1
OBE is important for students...As far i know many foreign varsity has OBE based system....So it is very important                                 ,1
Outcome based education system is far better than the traditional education system. The result of OBE system portrays that how much idea the students have regarding each of the topics of their syllabus.                                                         ,1
There is no need of OBE   it gives extra pressure.         ,0
OBE is practical to understand a topic very  easily. 	,1
OBE is good  because we can get clear idea  about course. 		,1
"To get high knowledge OBE is mandatory, it increases the idea of a subject.                 ",1
OBE focuses on planning and implementation so it's helpful for all students.                 ,1
We gain high knowledge from our course when authority added this on some  particular courses.                         ,1
Personally I don't like OBE        ,0
OBE is not a good system on education 	,0
It demonstrate the knowledge and skills needed for success in life so OBE is perfect for education                         ,1
It teaches us how to handle a problem in the perfect way.                ,1
Outcome base education means we get to know what is the outcome of education which depends on us how we manage us to gain knowledge from so I think it doesn't give extra benefits I think.                                                        ,0
Personally I don't appreciate OBE.,0
I  don't know what is the target of obe,0
I don't like OBE,0
OBE evaluation system is one kind of extra pain .	,0
Teacher can evaluate Mark's from exam questions so no need of obe		,0
OBE points out the main thing of a course so it's helpful to understand the concept.                         ,1
It increases the knowledge of a student. 	,1
OBE evaluation system is extra pain for the students. 	,0
OBE is not good.,0
One is not going well,0
We faced a lot of problem to understand obe        ,0
Because of OBE we have to effort more so I prefer obe in the course 		,1
In one word Obe is disgusting for me.        ,0
Some of us didn't know how to get over of our weakness of the topic so OBE OBE teaches how to guide myself to get over the weakness.                                         ,0
Obe doesn't bring any extra benefits so no need to add OBE in course curriculum.                         ,0
Obe evaluation system is painful         ,0
Obe is not that much helpful for students. 	,0
I failed in OBE so it doesn't bring benefits to me        ,0

"Some teachers doesn't know about OBE perfectly then how a student can know about OBE , it's a new system so at first teachers should gain knowledge in obe                                                ",0
"Obe exam question is like creative question ,we have to understand the basic thing and should have answer the question creativity.                                 ",1
I just like obe,1

I prefer better knowledge so I support obe evaluation                 ,1
Obe is disgusting ,0
"By the end of the educational experience, each student should have achieved the goal. ",1
"i think this system is very helpful for Intended Curriculum, Implemented Curriculum & Attained Curriculum.                        ",1
this obe base course is very effective.,1
I enjoyed the course as it enlightened newer concepts of Engineering education.                ,1
From my perspective the lecture could have been better in terms of delivery because there are some lacking in practice of trainer.                                ,0
It was a pleasure watching this system in courses.        ,1
obe base course is great to learn .	,1
I got a bad understanding of OBE and the learning taxonomies.                ,0
The course gave me very useful background information to help me engage stakeholders during educational software implementation projects.,1
This system is unusual in its approach.        ,0
It was a great experience while doing obe base course.,1
This is the actual scenario in assessing the academic sectors.,1
The outcome based education emphasized the importance of learning.                ,1
It provides me with a great opportunity to enhance my understanding towards OBE.                        ,1
Outcome-based learning is learner driven and aimed at achieving Outcomes.,1
OBE  increases our  thinking level.       ,1
Obe gives us too much stress because we need to attend an extra evaluation in a course ,0
If we focus on OBE we can give highest level of performance,1
we can get better result at the end of the course with followed OBE method,1
The OBE system is good for learners.,1
Obe stands for extended opportunities so that we can have more options to learn. ,1
It help students to learn what is mostly needed for the time and hour.,1
If we focus on OBE we can get over from any problem we face in our career. ,1
OBE departs from traditional education in its assumption that all students can learn well. ,1
OBE is the best system and OBE evaluation is the best way to evaluate.,1
At the end of the course teacher can take a small evaluation on the course so that he/she can know the lacking and get over from in the future.,1
"I support OBE , we need it in educational field. ",1
I have less idea about OBE. As I know OBE OBE evaluation is for higher graduation. ,0
OBE evaluation system is a major thing at this time.,1
Students only read books. But their practical knowledge is very poor. They can not find education as fun. They become very worried when exams begin. But shouldn’t be. So everyone should give focus on OBE evaluation system rather than others.,0
it is effective in every pros and cons. students can focus on every part of study material.,1
Good,1
Good initiative ,1
"If a person can't apply what he/she has learned, then his/her education is useless.",0
The reform in the health services that stresses on professionalism had brought the necessity to adopt outcome based education (OBE) in medical education,0
It is an approach of education that clearly identifies its intended final product – students' competencies by determining the final curriculum outcome-a head of planning the framework of the curriculum,1
It is an attempt to provide a comprehensive coverage of a very popular current trend in medical education.,1
Outcome‐based education means starting with a clear picture of what is important for students to be able to do.,1
"Outcome Based Education is nothing but a changing trend in 01st century schools, colleges and universities in many countries, and institutions. ",0
"Because of  OBE most teachers are teaching in traditional classroom setups, which are highly ""teacher-centered"" or taught with fixed curriculam.  ",0
" OBE is a shift towards ""Students-Centered"" classrooms, with focus on Students Learning Outcomes, and the abilities and competencies acquired as a result of attending classes.  ",1
Obe makes the job of teaching more challenging for teachers because it's all about practical knowledge.,1
The effect of OBE is many new knowledge and skills are therefore required in traditional teachers in order to ensure that they are capable to produce the required market needs and skill sets in their students.  ,1
Students are new with this evaluation so the teachers should be practical so that they can teach them in the right way.,0
If a student couldn't get the moral of the course then there were no need of evaluation because students had to know the basic first of the course. ,0
Obe makes the study more sensible ,1
Obe makes a student practical. ,1
Obe is for to rise up the inner knowledge of a student. ,1
OBE increases the thinking level of a student so it's better to evaluate the knowledge of a student. ,1
I can't understand that what is the profile of OBE system. ,0
Obe evaluation gives extra more pressure we can evaluate it into our term exam without taking an extra evaluation. ,0
I don't prefer OBE because already there are lots of lackings in educational field so we have to fix the leakings first.,0
Students are expected to be able to do more challenging tasks other than to memorize and reproduce what was taught so it increases the creativity of a student. ,1
OBE evaluation is the best way to make the students more practical.,1
"Student can show their abilities to think, question, research, and make decisions based on the findings and OBE  makes it simple. ",1
"Obe system ensures that all learners are equipped with the knowledge, competence and qualities needed to be successful after they exit their educational system.",1
Obe ensures high order learning so we have to give more effort in learning ..,1
Obe structures and operates programs of the university so that those outcomes can be achieved and maximized for all learners. ,1
If a student wants to be successful then he or she need to follow the OBE system.,1
Obe system can give a learner better future.,1
Obviously a new system in education is a good approach for educational development so I think OBE is better option.,1
"Outcome-based education is perhaps the most exciting and potentially successful  curricular innovation for school, college and universities. ",1
"Outcome-based education is a systemic reform effort which focuses on predetermined outcomes, or curriculum goals.",1
Sometimes OBE evaluation gives us more pressure because we have done some of the course without knowing that what is the  purpose of it and what we gain from it.,0
Some teachers didn't tell us the right way to achieve the outcomes because of their leakings .,0
Most students can achieve high standards if they are given appropriate opportunities .,1
"Obe means that teachers should establish high, challenging standards of performance in order to encourage students to engage deeply in what they are learning.",1
It is helping students to achieve high standards is linked very closely with the idea that successful learning promotes more successful learning. ,1
It gives a strong sense of purpose to everything in working life.,1
It breakthrough approaches to learning in education. ,1
Obe gives implementation guidelines to better quality assurance in education. ,1
I have encountered many of the realist observations and i think this is helpful to those who are serious in the teaching profession. ,1
This system really helped me for my individual growth as a learner. ,1
I think OBE can be helpful for my career.,1
Students can get a great overview on the course. ,1
Outcome base education course material was given in a very professional manner so the presenter should be well educated and creative. ,1
Outcome base education is very informative and educative.,1
I like to learn more about OBE base  courses. ,1
If we learn the course in practical way then we can present anything in great way.,1
I am very happy that I enrolled for OBE base courses. ,1
Obe cleared many doubts of  a course. ,1
I am new in this system but it is going well so far.,1
I don't like the concepts of OBE.,0
The explanation is clear and hence it is easy to understand ,1
Outcome base education motivates me to put focus on my career.,1
I got many new information from OBE.,1
"I believe, it has made me a better learner. ",1
All educational institutions should move to obe system of education. ,1
Outcome base education is not interesting. ,0
Obe is a good match on a course that I looking for.,1
The quality on teaching process sometimes very disappointing. ,0
Sometimes student faces many problems because of lackings of resources. ,0
It was a bad experience in obe,0
Obe base courses are well elaborated. ,0
We achieve better understanding of the course. ,1

A good education system makes a learner expert and I think OBE is a perfect education system. ,1
Obe base course will really helpful to change the generation to better one.,1
Obe base courses are great choice of me.,1
Teaching skills are yet to be improved. ,0

It gives the light on all aspects related to teaching learning concept.,1
Obe is difficult to follow ,0
It has been extremely enlightening ,1
This course has helped set me on the right path.,1
OBE gives so many new ways of teaching to change my views  towards teaching ways really good and useful knowledge. ,1
It was an excellent and very informative system ,1
I am getting the better understanding of subject being taught in OBE courses. ,1
I got many new things to learn. ,1
This system enriched my knowledge. ,1
It will help me to contribute to the quality of education. ,1
"So far, the course has helped me to re-evaluate resources .",1
It is a good match and exactly addressing what i was looking for.,1
Most of the concepts I am aware already but the course delivery is not captivating. ,0

"i think obe is useful in terms of quality learning,  , ",1
i think every course must have this OBE,1
it verifies how well the course is taken and how qualified the students are.,1
OBE has been helpful. The questions allow us to think more critically.,1
Focusing on results Outcome-based education(OBE) generates a transparent expectation of the top results,1
"Students can understand what they expect, and teachers can understand what they need to demonstrate throughout the course",1
"it has been argued, and for good reasons, that outcome-based education (OBE) represents the most important development in education in the past two decades.",1
A clear specification of the end product of training and the associated learning outcomes is essential for effective curriculum planning.,1
It's a good system,1
"From this system, we are getting full knowledge about our courses and we know which part of our courses is more important and have to learn to do well in the future.",1
OBE evaluation system isn't really much necessary even though I think it is given so that students gain technicality,0
Traditional system puts a lot of pressure on a student suddenly and the student focuses on just writing sentences making different senses instead of focusing on understanding deeply which more focused in OBE,1
outcome based education basically focus on an important topics in a particular course to ensure if a student learnt that properly or not.,1
OBE have some criteria for marking to make sure that every students concept is clear about that specific topic. As a result it helps a student to test his knowledge about a topic and also it makes them perfect learner.,1
"OBE is a great evaluation process. But from my perspective ,the questions for OBE should be more technical.",0
"I have experienced for most of the courses, the question for OBE is kind of open secret. For which I have a doubt whether the purpose of this evolution is fulfilled at all .",0
Its very much helpful for us because it helps us to learn part by part of a topic and evaluation process is very much clear for us also,1
"OBE is the best way to evaluate  . By this system, we learn technical this and also learn new things. ",1
It is definitely a good match to my Engineering profession. ,1

Till now  this OBE system has given a good insight into education. ,1

It made my brain smile and I'm inspired and motivated to do even more as an educator. ,1
